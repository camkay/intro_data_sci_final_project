\abstract{
The present study examined individual differences in interactions with
social media content and media consumption in American adults. Secondary
data analyses were conducted using an early 2018 phone survey collected
by the Pew Research Center (2018). Results showed that older age was
associated with lower social media use overall, but these age-related
differences varied across social media sites. That is, age-related
differences were largest with respect to Snapchat and Twitter use
relative to Facebook use. Male respondents also reported less frequency
of social media use overall but exhibitted greater use of both Twitter
and YouTube than female respondents. Examination of media consumption
revealed that both age and media format are significant predictors of
the volume of media consumption. Older respondents were reading more
than younger respondents, and books in print were read less than those
in electronic formats. A marginal interaction between age and media
format suggests that the amount of media consumed increases with age
more for individuals using exclusively electronic or audiobook formats
than fror those using exclusively print or mixed media formats.

\maketitle

Social media sites are commonly defined as an internet-based service
allowing for the creation and broadcast of user-generated information
(Boyd \& Ellison, 2008; Kaplan \& Haenlein, 2010; Obar \& Wildman,
2015). Obar and Wildman (2015) emphasize the user-generated aspect of
this definition, arguing that this content is the lifeblood of social
media. Although that may sound hyperbolic, it logically follows that if
a site is created with the express purpose of providing user-generated
content, it must have user-generated content to function as intended. By
way of illustration, without videos created by users, YouTube, a social
media site that allows its users to upload and share videos, would fail
to serve its primary purpose. Netflix, a site that allows users to only
stream videos, does not require user-generated content, as it does not
serve user-generated content, and, by extension is not a social media
site. Beyond the functional aspects of social media sites, the
user-generated focus also highlights the importance of individual
differences in the user-service relationship, as users invariably have
characteristics that affect how they consume and generate content.

Moreover, in an increasingly internet-based world, many new formats for
media consumption have come forward. The days of reading the morning
paper as the only source of world news are gone; rather, the internet
provides a myriad of other media formats from which to choose. With
increasing usage of digital media formats in recent years, there has
been a growing interest in whether or not the format of media
consumption relates to how well information is learned and retained
(Delgado, Vargas, Ackerman, \& Salmer√≥n, 2018; DeZee, Durning, \&
Denton, 2005; Margolin, Driscoll, Toland, \& Kegler, 2013). DeZee et al.
(2005) found that students in their third year of a medical clerkship
did not show any performance differences regardless of whether they
chose to use electronic or print resources as their primary method of
study. However, a meta-analysis by Delgado et al. (2018) found that
paper-based reading may result in better comprehension than
digital-based reading. Inconsistent findings from prior work highlights
the importance of understanding individual differences in media
consumption and choices to interact with media in various formats.

To explore these individual differences in how people both generate
social media content and consume media in general, we conducted
secondary data analyses using recent survey data collected by the Pew
Research Center (2018). First, we examined how frequency of social media
use might vary as a function of sex, age, and social media site. Second,
we examined relationships between age and media format and how these two
factors may predict the volume of media consumption.

\section{Method}\label{method}

As stated above, survey data examining attitudes towards technology and
use of technology and social media was collected by the Pew Research
Center (2018). For the current study, we conducted a secondary data
analysis looking at factors that relate to frequency of social media
use, as well as factors that relate to overall media consumption.

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

Two thousand, two people were surveyed by telephone (75.02\% cell phone;
24.98\% landline) over a period of 7 days in January of 2018. We
excluded any participants who reported that they do not even
occasionally use the internet or email (\emph{n} = 273). The resulting
sample comprised 1729 people (45.29\% female). Ages ranged from 18 to 97
(\emph{M} age = 48.29; \emph{SD} age =
17.94)\footnote{Note that the descriptive statistics for age are slightly lower than reality. Ages 97 and older were recorded as simply 97 in the data.}.
Concerning race, 68.48\% identified as white, 12.78\% identified as
black, 3.64\% identified as Asian, 2.95\% identified as mixed race, and
12.15\% refused to answer or reported being from some other race.

\subsection{Materials and Procedure}\label{materials-and-procedure}

Research personnel were instructed to read from a script while
interviewing each participant. For landline users, the script began as
follows: \enquote{Hello, I am \_\_\_\_\_ calling on behalf of the Pew
Research Center. We are conducting a telephone opinion survey about some
important issues today and we would like to include your household. May
I please speak with the YOUNGEST {[}RANDOMIZE: (MALE / FEMALE){]}, age
18 or older, who is now at home? {[}IF NO MALE/FEMALE, ASK: May I please
speak with the YOUNGEST (FEMALE / MALE), age 18 or older, who is now at
home?{]}}

For cell phone users, the script was slightly different: \enquote{Hello,
I am \_\_\_\_\_ calling on behalf of the Pew Research Center. We are
conducting a telephone opinion survey about some important issues today.
I know I am calling you on a cell phone. If you would like to be
reimbursed for your cell phone minutes, we will pay all eligible
respondents \$5 for participating in this survey. This is NOT a sales
call.}

Once participants passed initial screening (e.g., 18 years of age or
older) and provided verbal consent to the interview, they were asked a
series of questions pertaining to internet use (e.g., \enquote{How often
do you use the internet?}; options ranged from 1 = \enquote{Almost
Constantly} to 5 = \enquote{Less Often}), social media use (e.g.,
\enquote{Do you use any of the following social media sites online or on
your cell phone: Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube,
WhatsApp, Interest, and LinkedIn?}), as well as perceptions of social
media's influence on the self and society (e.g., \enquote{When you add
up all the advantages and disadvantages of the internet, would you say
the internet has mostly been a good thing or a bad thing for society?};
options included: \enquote{Good Thing}, \enquote{Bad Thing},
\enquote{Some of Both}, and \enquote{Don't Know}). Participants were
also asked about reading habits (e.g., \enquote{During the past 12
months, how many books (print, electronic, and audiobooks) did you read
either all or part of the way through?}) and reading format preferences
(e.g., \enquote{Thinking about all of the books you have read in the
past 12 months, were any of those printed books, audiobooks, or
E-books?}). The interview ended with a series of demographic questions
assessing variables including participant sex, age, race, marrital
status, education, current employment status, income, and political
affiliation.

\section{Results}\label{results}

First, we sought to examine how frequency of social media use might vary
as a function of sex, age, social media site, and the interaction
between these variables. Using the \emph{lme4} package by (Bates et al.,
2015), we ran a comparison of seven linear mixed-effects models
predicting frequency of social media use from age, social media site,
sex, and the interactions among these variables. Our first model
included only the random effects. Specifically, we suspected that
participants may have certain response style in evaluating their
frequency of social media use. We entered the subject as a random
intercept to account for interdependence in the participants' ratings.
Although in many cases the scenario or context (i.e., social media site)
would be entered as a random slope, we did not wish to generalize beyond
these sites.

Our second model added gender, followed by age in our third model. The
fourth model included the social media site in question. The fifth
through seventh models added (1) the interaction between sex and age,
(2) the interaction between sex and social media site, and (3) the
interaction between age and social media site.

As shown in Table 1, we found that the addition of age, social media
site, the interaction between sex and social media site, and the
interaction between age and social media site all explained a
significant proportion of variance in social media site usage frequency.
Using the \emph{lmerTest} package from Kuznetsova et al. (2017) to
approximate degrees of freedom with Satterthwaite's method, we found
that age is associated with lower social media use, \(\beta\) = -0.10,
\emph{SE} = .03, \emph{p} = .003. Furthermore, Snapchat is used more
often than Facebook (\(\beta\) = .17, \emph{SE} = .04, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001) and Twitter is used more often than Facebook
(\(\beta\) = -0.18, \emph{SE} = .04, \emph{p} \textless{} .001).
However, age interacts with the specific social media site, insofar that
age results in even lower rates of social media use in the case of
Instagram (\(\beta\) = -0.28, \emph{SE} = .04, \emph{p} \textless{}
.001), Snapchat (\(\beta\) = -0.32, \emph{SE} = .04, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001), Twitter (\(\beta\) = -0.10, \emph{SE} = .04,
\emph{p}= .017), and YouTube (\(\beta\) = -0.35, \emph{SE} = .05,
\emph{p} \textless{} .001) when compared to Facebook.

Although the model comparison did not indicate an increase in predictive
ability from the introduction of participant gender, we did find that
males (in comparison to females) reported less frequency of social media
use when using the approximated degrees of freedom, \(\beta\) = -0.15,
\emph{SE} = .05, \emph{p} = .005. When compared to Facebook, however,
men exhibitted a greater frequency of using Twitter (\(\beta\) = .09,
\emph{SE} = .02, \emph{p} \textless{} .001) and YouTube (\(\beta\) =
.18, \emph{SE} = .03, \emph{p} \textless{} .001) than women did.

A comparison of the full model with random effects to the full model
without random effects, revealed that the random effects explained a
significant proportion of the variance in social media site use,
\(\chi^2\)(1) = 176.01, \emph{p} \textless{} .001. In fact, grouping
ratings by participant explained 21.65\% of the variance in the
frequency of using a social media site. A visual inspection of model
residuals suggested a slight negative skew, but no heteroscedasticity.
We also quantitively inspected the variables for potential
multicollinearity within the fullest model without the interaction
effects. No multicollinearity was detected (\emph{VIF} = 1.01 - 1.04).

\end{figure}

We next sought to examine how media consumption may vary as a function
of age as well as media format (i.e.~individuals exclusively using print
media, audiobooks, electronic media or combinations of the three). To
explore this data we used the total number of books read in the past
year as an indicator of media consumption. Survey respondents who
endorsed only using a single type of media format were grouped into
either print, audio, or electronic as appropriate. Respondents who
endorsed using more than one type of media format were grouped together
into a \enquote{mixed media} bin. Next, we calculated the average number
of books read, grouped by age and media format (see Figure
\ref{fig:fig4}A). There appear to be age differences in the number of
books read as a function of media format. For example, we see that
audiobook usage seems to be more prevalent among the older respondents.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{center}
\end{table}

To look at the relationships between the average books read in 2018,
age, and media format, we ran a multiple regression predicting the
average number of books read in the past year from age and media format
as well as their interaction (see Figure \ref{fig:fig4}B). Results
showed a significant main effect of age (\(F[1, 200] = 7.99\),
\(\mathit{MSE} = 270.97\), \(p = .005\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .038\)) with
older adults reading more books in 2018 than younger adults. We also saw
a significant main effect of media format (\(F[3, 200] = 6.17\),
\(\mathit{MSE} = 270.97\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .085\)) and
pairwise comparisons revealed that books in print format were read less
than those in electronic (\(t(48.42) = -2.10\), \(p = .041\)) format. We
found no difference in the number of books read exclusively in a print
format and the number of books read through the audiobook format
(\(t(34.31) = -0.17\), \(p = .863\)). However, we did find that more
books were read using a mixed media approach than either exclusively
print (\(t(135.94) = -4.99\), \(p < .001\)) or exclusively audiobooks
(\(t(36.64) = -2.68\), \(p = .011\)). Lastly, we found no difference
between media consumed by individuals who reported the used mixed media
sources compared to those who exclusively preferred electronic formats
(\(t(50.23) = -0.04\), \(p = .967\), see Table \ref{tab:tab2}). Finally,
there was a marginal interaction effect between age and media format
where changes in average books read increased with age more for
individuals exclusively using electronic formats or audiobooks than for
individuals exclusively using print media or a mixed media approach.
